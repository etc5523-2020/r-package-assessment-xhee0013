[![R build status](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-xhee0013/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-xhee0013/actions)

The goal of covid19tracker is to interactively visualize the situation of COVID-19 cases in three countries from January to September and provide a platform for performing and reviewing the change of cases distribution for each regions in all countries.

## Installation

You can install the released version of covid19tracker from [Github](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-xhee0013) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-xhee0013")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r country}
library(covid19tracker)
library(tibble)
covid19_count
```
```{r region}
covid19_region
```


<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
